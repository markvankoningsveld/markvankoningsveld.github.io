The new publication Dredging for Sustainable Infrastructure was presented in the Beurs van Berlage in Amsterdam on November 19th, 2018. I am proud that both our Frame of Reference method and our turbidity source term assessment method have been fully adopted in this publication as part of Chapter 4 "Assessment and management of sustainability".
