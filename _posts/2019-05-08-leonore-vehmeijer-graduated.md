Leonore Vehmeijer graduated on her thesis "Measures for the reduction of CO2 emissions, by the inland shipping fleet, on the Rotterdam-Antwerp corridor". In this thesis she used <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3341517">OpenTNSim</a> to simulate IWT traffic over the Rotterdam-Atwerp corridor under different scenarios, to subsequently estimate CO2 footprints.
