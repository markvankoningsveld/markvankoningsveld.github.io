Vibeke van der Bilt graduated on her thesis "Assessing emission performance of dredging projects". In this thesis she used <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3304278">OpenCLSim</a> to simulate dredging project logistics while adding algorithms to estimate energy usage, to subsequently estimate CO2 footprints.
