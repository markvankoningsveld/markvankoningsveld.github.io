The Frame of Reference approach provides a generic approach to value assessment and management. Key to the approach is to make important aspects of a management issue explicit to facilitate interaction between actors with different backgrounds. An important question is which elements should be made explicit as a minimum.

Based on an analysis of the successful Dutch 'Dynamic Preservation' policy for coastal sediment management, it was proposed that a 'basic' frame of reference should at least include:
<ul>
  <li>A strategic objective;</li>
  <li>An operational objective; and</li>
  <li>A decision recipe containing a foursome of elements, viz.:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A quantitative state concept;</li>
    <li>A benchmarking procedure;</li>
    <li>An intervention procedure; and</li>
    <li>An evaluation procedure confronting the operational as well as the
        strategic objective.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
